### 💻 **Lab Prerequisites**  

* If you do not already have a **GitHub** account, you will need to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

### 🔐 **Recommendations**  

* Use an existing **GitHub** account if you have one. **GitHub** is more likely to block a new account as spam.

* Configure [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your **GitHub account** to reduce the chances of your account being marked as **spam**.
